                <h3><b>Make the Rice</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        First thing to start prepping is to make a batch of rice.
                        Use a rice cooker and keep the rice to water ratio 1:1.

                <h3><b>Preparing the Vegetables</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        In this step, what is most important is to have an onion,
                        garlic cloves, bell peppers, ginger root, and spinach (or other type of greens
                        of your choice) as the main vegetables to chop up. The most fun part 
                        about this meal is that you can add any other vegetable to the mix that 
                        is unused at home to add to this dish. The sky is the limit!
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><b>Pan Frying all the ingredients together</b></h3>
                    <p> 
                        Take a piece of butter or a tablespoon of olive oil to grease the pan first. 
                        Then add the vegetables all at once. Then after the onions look
                        browned, that's when you add the rice.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><b>Sauces</b></h3>
                    <p> 
                        While the rice is cooking in the pan with the vegetables, add the 
                        desired amount of soy sauce to taste, and also a line of sesame oil.
                        Stir with rice and rest of ingredients in the pan until the rice is warm and
                        everything is mixed in well.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><b>Add the eggs!</b></h3>
                    <p> 
                        Now for the final addition to this meal before it's ready to serve.
                        The eggs! Add as many as you would like (I usually do 3 or 4) and keep
                        mixing until you see that the egg is being evenly cooked throughout the dish.
                        It will be difficult to keep the stovetop clean during this step so it's ok to
                        spill some fried rice here and there depending on how small or big your pan is.
                    </p>
